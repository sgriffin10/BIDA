# #Python Collections (Arrays)
# # There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
# #
# # List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
# thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# print(thislist)
#
# print(thislist[1])
#
# thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"
# print(thislist)
#
# for x in thislist:
#   print(x)
#
# if "apple" in thislist:
#     print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list")
#
# print(len(thislist))
#
# thislist.append("orange")
# print(thislist)
#
# thislist.insert(1, "orange")
# print(thislist)
#
# thislist.remove("banana")
# print(thislist)
#
# # Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists.
# #
# # Method	Description
# # append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
# # clear()	Removes all the elements from the list
# # copy()	Returns a copy of the list
# # count()	Returns the number of elements with the specified value
# # extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
# # index()	Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
# # insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
# # pop()	    Removes the element at the specified position
# # remove()	Removes the item with the specified value
# # reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
# # sort()	Sorts the list
#
# # Look up and practice rest of the collections
# # Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
# print(thistuple)
#
# thistuple[1] = "blackcurrant"
# print(thistuple)
#
# # Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# print(thisset)
#
# # Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.
# thisdict =	{
#   "brand": "Ford",
#   "model": "Mustang",
#   "year": 1964
# }
# print(thisdict)
